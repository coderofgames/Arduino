This outputs a clock signal from pin 11 of an Arduino. The oscilloscope 
must be grounded to the Arduino grouund.

Setting the number of the ocr2aval sets the clock frequency.

Note: The output is something like +- 5 volts so probably
(according to my scope) 

- potential divider to make a lower voltage
